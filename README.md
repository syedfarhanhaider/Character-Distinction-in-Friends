# Character Vectorization and Information Retrieval in Friends Script Data

## Description
This project focuses on developing vector representations for dialogue lines spoken by characters in the "Friends" TV series. The aim is to create distinct vector representations for each character and evaluate their effectiveness using simple information retrieval classification methods. This approach is designed to optimize vector representations to ensure maximal distinction between different characters' dialogues.

## Objectives
- To create distinct vector representations for each character in the Friends script data.
- To optimize these representations for maximal distinction between characters.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of these representations using information retrieval methods.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

bash

git clone https://github.com/syedfarhanhaider/friends-character-vectorization.git

cd friends-character-vectorization

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
The project includes scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the process of vectorization and information retrieval:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preprocessing the script data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Techniques applied to extract features from the text data.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Methods for training and evaluating the information retrieval models.

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to view the Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis.

## Data
The data used in this project consists of dialogues from the "Friends" TV series. Due to copyright considerations, the data is not included in this repository. You can obtain similar datasets from publicly available sources.

## Results
The project successfully identifies key parameters and techniques for character vectorization, showing how different preprocessing and feature extraction methods impact the distinction between character vectors.
